                the one thing which differ from us and our competetors is that we bring the standerd google designe concept to our website 
                as the user preference. it will give the end user the experience ofan application on your website.
                it will work best with the SPA single page application concept to make it as an real low cost web app. while combining 
                google designe to the SPA it will be double win situation for the end user.
